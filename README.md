🌱 What I Do
Navigating the intersection of climate, energy, and digital storytelling.

🔎 Climate & Energy 
I’m passionate about making complex environmental data more accessible. From geospatial visualizations to exploring carbon markets, I’m learning how to turn raw data into stories that spark change.

📊 Sustainability x Strategy
With a background in environmental science and energy management, I’ve worked on EIA projects, WASH programs, and conservation campaigns. Now, I’m diving into tools that blend data, communication, and systems thinking to support real-world climate action.

📈 Learning Marketing for Good
As I grow in this space, I'm building skills in digital marketing, content creation, and project visibility — because great ideas deserve to be seen, shared, and scaled.
